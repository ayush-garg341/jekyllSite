This is a sample post which I created while learning jekyll from scratch through step by step tutorials. One thing I must say, "jekyll is very impressive" and offers a lot of power to the bloggin website. I have become a huge fan of jekyll and recommend it to anyone who wants to make his/her blog website.

One last word, jekyll uses Liquid Templating Language which offers three things.
1. Objects
2. Tags
3. Filters

Jekyll supports both markdown and HTML.
