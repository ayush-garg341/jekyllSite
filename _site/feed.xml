&lt;p&gt;Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jill</name></author><summary type="html">An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kiwifruit</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/21/kiwifruit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kiwifruit" /><published>2020-06-21T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-06-21T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/06/21/kiwifruit</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/21/kiwifruit.html">&lt;p&gt;Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen’s egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ted</name></author><summary type="html">Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sample Post</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/20/sample.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sample Post" /><published>2020-06-20T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-06-20T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/06/20/sample</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/20/sample.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a sample post which I created while learning jekyll from scratch through step by step tutorials. One thing I must say, “jekyll is very impressive” and offers a lot of power to the bloggin website. I have become a huge fan of jekyll and recommend it to anyone who wants to make his/her blog website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last word, jekyll uses Liquid Templating Language which offers three things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Objects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll supports both markdown and HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ayush Garg</name></author><summary type="html">This is a sample post which I created while learning jekyll from scratch through step by step tutorials.
