<p>This is a sample post which I created while learning jekyll from scratch through step by step tutorials. One thing I must say, “jekyll is very impressive” and offers a lot of power to the bloggin website. I have become a huge fan of jekyll and recommend it to anyone who wants to make his/her blog website.</p>

<p>One last word, jekyll uses Liquid Templating Language which offers three things.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Objects</li>
  <li>Tags</li>
  <li>Filters</li>
</ol>

<p>Jekyll supports both markdown and HTML.</p>
