      <p>This is a sample post which I created while learning jekyll from scratch through step by step tutorials. One thing I must say, “jekyll is very impressive” and offers a lot of power to the bloggin website. I have become a huge fan of jekyll and recommend it to anyone who wants to make his/her blog website.</p>
